              Quick stress relief. The best way to reduce stress quickly and
reliably is by using your senses—what you see, hear, smell, taste,
and touch—or movement. By viewing a favorite photo, smelling

a specific scent, listening to a favorite piece of music, tasting a
piece of gum, or hugging a pet, for example, you can quickly relax
and focus yourself. Of course, not everyone responds to each
sensory experience in the same way. Something that relaxes

one person may do nothing but irritate someone else. The key

is to experiment with your senses and discover the sensory
experiences that work best for you.

          Drink water - Drink plenty of water. It helps reduce puffiness. When
