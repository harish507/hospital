              <p>When bleeding is severe, it can be dramatic and distressing. If someone’s bleeding isn’t controlled quickly, they may develop shock and lose consciousness. Shock does not mean emotional shock, but is a life-threatening condition, often caused by loss of blood.</p><br>
             <p>If someone’s bleeding from their mouth or nose, they may find it hard to breathe, so you should keep a close eye on them in case they become unresponsive.</p><br>
              <h3  color="danger"><b>What you need to do - severe bleeding</b></h3>
              <hr color="danger">
              <p>Your priority is to stop the bleeding. Protect yourself by wearing gloves.
              </p>
              <p>If the wound is covered by the casualty's clothing, remove or cut the clothes to uncover the wound.</p><br>
              <b>If there an object in the wound</b> <br>
              <p>If there’s an object in there, don’t pull it out, because it may be acting as a plug to reduce the bleeding. Instead, leave it in and apply pressure either side of it with a pad (such as a clean cloth) or fingers, until a sterile dressing is available.</p><br>
              <b>If there's no object in the wound</b>
              <p>Follow the steps below for treating severe bleeding.</p>
              
              <ul>
                    <li><b>Step 1 of 2: Press it</b></li>
                    <p>Put direct pressure on the wound with your fingers, using a sterile dressing if possible, to stop blood escaping.</p>

                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Step 2 of 2: Call for medical help</b></li><br>
                  <li>Firmly wrap a bandage around the pad or dressing on top of the wound to control the bleeding. Make it firm enough to maintain pressure but not so tight that it restricts their circulation.</li>
                  <li>Treat them for shock: lay them down with their head low and thier legs raised and supported.</li>
                  <li>If blood shows through the pad or dressing, don’t remove it: apply a second dressing on top of the first one. If blood then seeps through both dressings, remove both of them and replace them with a fresh dressing. When changing dressings, make sure you keep pressure applied to where the bleeding is coming from.</li>
                  <li>If they become unresponsive at any point, open their airway, check their breathing, and prepare to treat someone who has become unresponsive.</li>
                </ul>
