            Applying an ice pack to the painful area within 24 hours of an injury
can help keep inflammation to a minimum and ease discomfort

by decreasing the ability of nerves to send pain signals to the

brain. Place ice cubes in a plastic bag, then apply the bag on top

of a thin towel that has been placed on the skin. Leave the ice

pack on for 20 minutes, take it off for 30 minutes, then replace

it for another 20 minutes.

            Ginger root, which is used to cure vomiting, can also be used in
            the treatment of back pain. The anti-inflammatory compounds in
            ginger can give you relief from a backache. Apply some ginger
            paste on the affected area, followed by eucalyptus oil. Cut thin
            slices of fresh ginger root and put them in a pan of boiling water.
            Simmer and boil it on low heat for about 30 minutes. Allow the
            mixture to cool to room temperature and strain it. Add honey
            and then drink it. You can also make an herbal tea with one-half
            teaspoon of black pepper corns, one-half teaspoon of cloves and
            one teaspoon of ginger powder.

            Basil leaves can also come to your rescue when suffering from

            a backache. Add 8 to 10 basil leaves to one cup of water and
            
            boil it until the water is evaporates to half. Let it cool to room
            temperature and then add a pinch of salt. For mild pain, drink this
            concoction once daily; for severe pain, do that twice a day.

            A hot cup of chamomile tea will help relax tense muscle tissues
            that can be the cause or a related symptom of a backache. You can
            buy pre-packaged chamomile tea or make your own.

            Garlic is another ingredient that can help treat a backache. Simply
            eat two to three cloves of garlic every morning on empty stomach.
            You can also massage your back with garlic oil. To make garlic
            
            oil, heat some coconut oil, mustard oil or sesame oil on low heat
            and then add 8 to 10 cloves of garlic to it. Fry the garlic until it is
            brown. Strain the oil and let it cool to room temperature. Massage
            your back gently with the oil. Leave it on for some time and then
            take a bath in warm water.

Get a massage. If you're lucky enough to have an accommodating
spouse, friend, or roommate, ask him or her to give you a
rubdown. As you lie facedown on a bed or sofa, ask your
masseuse to knead your back muscles. Local massage therapists
may also make house calls if you don't feel able to visit one of
them. Check the yellow pages for listings or ask your doctor

Milk is a rich source of calcium that your body needs for
