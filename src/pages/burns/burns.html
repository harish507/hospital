              <p>Burns and scalds are damage to the skin caused by heat. A burn is usually caused by dry heat, like fire, a hot iron, or the sun. A scald is caused by wet heat, like steam or a hot cup of tea.</p><br>
              <h3  color="danger">What to look for</h3>
              <hr color="danger">

              <p>If you think someone has a burn or scald, there are five key things to look for:
              </p><br>
              <ol>
                    <li>Red skin</li>
                    <li>Swelling</li>
                    <li>Blisters may form on the skin later on</li>
                    <li>The skin may peel</li>
                    <li>The skin may be white or scorched</li>
                 </ol>
                <h2 color="dark">What you need to do</h2>
                <hr color="danger">

                <p>Stop the burning getting any worse, by moving the casualty away from the source of heat.</p><br>
                <p>Start cooling the burn as quickly as possible. Run it under cool water for at least ten minutes or until the pain feels better. (Don’t use ice, creams or gels – they can damage tissues and increase risk of infection).</p><br>
                <p>Assess how bad the burn is. It is serious if it is:</p><br>
                <ol>
                 <li>larger than the size of the casualty's hand</li>
                  <li>on the face, hands or feet</li>
                   <li>a deep burn</li>
                 
                </ol>
                <p>If it is serious, call for emergency medical help.</p><br>
                <p>Remove any jewellery or clothing near the burn (unless it is stuck to it).</p><br>
                <p>Cover the burned area with kitchen cling film or another clean, non-fluffy material, like a clean plastic bag. This will protect from infection.</p><br>
                <p>If necessary, treat for shock (shock is a life-threatening condition, not to be confused with emotional shock).</p><br>
                <p>
                  If you are unsure if the burn is serious then tell the person to see a doctor.</p><br>
