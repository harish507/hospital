              <p>Shock (not to be confused with emotional shock) is a life-threatening condition which happens when the body isn’t getting enough flow of blood.
                This means that the cells don’t get enough oxygen to enable them to work properly, which can lead to damage of the vital organs like the brain and the heart.</p>

                <hr color="danger">
                  <ol>
                   <li>
                    Lay them down with their head low and legs raised and supported, to increase the flow of blood to their head.</li><br>
                   <li>Call for medical help and say you think they are in shock, and explain what you think caused it (such as bleeding or a heart attack).</li><br>
                   <li>Loosen any tight clothing around the neck, chest and waist to make sure it doesn’t constrict their blood flow
                   </li><br>
                   <li>Fear and pain can make shock worse, by increasing the body’s demand for oxygen, so while you wait for help to arrive, it’s important to keep them comfortable, warm and calm. Do this by covering them with a coat or blanket and comforting and reassuring them</li><br>
                   <li>Keep checking their breathing, pulse and level of response.</li><br>
                   <li>If they lose consciousness at any point, open their airway, check their breathing, and prepare to treat someone who has become unconscious.</li><br>
