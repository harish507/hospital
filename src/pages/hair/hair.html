            Aloe Vera juice is very effective to stop hair loss. Pure aloe gel can
            be applied directly to the scalp. This is helpful for preventing hair
            loss due to irritated, dry or infected scalp. Aloe Vera balances the
            pH level of scalp. After massaging the head with aloe gel, wait for
            few hours and then wash the hair with lukewarm water. You should
            do this twice a week for best results.
