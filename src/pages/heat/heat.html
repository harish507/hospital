              <p>Heatstroke is caused by a failure of the thermostat in the brain which regulates the body temperature. If someone has a high fever or has been exposed to heat for a long time, then their body can become dangerously overheated.</p><br>
                <h2 color="dark">What to look for - heatstroke</h2>
                <hr color="danger">

            <p>These are the six key things to look for:</p><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Headache, dizziness and discomfort</li>
                    <li>Restlessness and confusion</li>
                    <li>Hot flushed and dry skin</li>
                    <li>A fast deterioration in the level of response</li>
                    <li>A full bounding pulse</li>
                    <li>Body temperature above 40°C (104°F)</li>
                 </ol>
                <h2 color="dark">What you need to do - heatstroke</h2>
                <hr color="danger">

                <ol>
                 <li>Quickly move them to a cool place and remove their outer clothing but ensure you maintain their dignity.</li>
                  <li>Then call 999/112 for an ambulance.</li> 
                  <li>Wrap them in a cold wet sheet and keep pouring cold water over it until their temperature falls to at least 38°C (or 100.4°F). Measure this with a thermometer under their tongue or under their armpit.</li>
                  <li>If you can’t find a sheet, fan them or sponge them down with cold water to keep them cool.</li>
                  <li>Once their temperature seems to have gone back to normal, replace the wet sheet with a dry sheet.</li>
                  <li>While waiting for help to arrive, keep checking their temperature, as well as their breathing, pulse and level of response.</li>
                  <li>If they start getting hot again, repeat the cooling process to lower their temperature.</li>
                  <li>If they lose responsiveness at any point, open their airway, check their breathing and prepare to treat someone who’s become unresponsive.</li>
